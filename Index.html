      <h2><b> Getting started with C Programming </b></h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Classic C Programmin </strong> To communicate with machines who
        speak binary, we do so in a language that’s closer to our own natural
        language. Such as English, French, Swahili or Arabic. Programming
        languages are close to our natural languages. But they are more
        structured and must be thoroughly learned. They could be high level or
        low level languages. High level programming languages are farther away
        from the machine language than low level languages. This “farther away”
        is usually called an abstraction , but we will not go into that in this
        series. Let’s not get distracted :)
